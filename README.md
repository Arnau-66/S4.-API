# 🌱 Sprint 4 - Development Branch: API Integration with TypeScript

This `develop` branch contains the **most up-to-date version** of the Sprint 4 project for the IT Academy Bootcamp.  
Here, we iteratively build and improve the TypeScript-based application that fetches and displays data from multiple public APIs.

## 🚧 Status

This branch is **under development**. It contains:
- Work-in-progress implementations
- Partial testing of modules
- Incremental commits and updates before merging to `main`

## 📌 Project Requirements

- Use **TypeScript** to organize and structure the codebase.
- Create a centralized function to **fetch data from multiple APIs**:
  - **Random Joke APIs**:
    - `https://icanhazdadjoke.com/` (dad jokes)
    - `https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random` (Chuck Norris jokes)
  - **Weather API**:
    - `https://wttr.in/?format=3`
- Display the fetched data in the DOM using vanilla HTML/CSS.
- The joke shown should be **randomly selected** from one of the two joke APIs.
- Implement **modular architecture**: separate logic into files like `main.ts`, `api.ts`, `dom.ts`, etc.
- Use `fetch()` to make API calls with proper error handling.

## 🧠 Development Goals

- Build a maintainable **TypeScript project from scratch**
- Apply **modular JavaScript/TypeScript structure**
- Practice with **API integration** and response formats (JSON / text)
- Implement **DOM updates** based on fetched data
- Improve code reliability with `try/catch` and meaningful error messages

## 🔁 Workflow

- Features and updates are committed to this branch.
- Once stable and tested, the code will be merged into the `main` branch for final delivery.

## 🛠️ Technologies in Use

- TypeScript
- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript (compiled)
- Public APIs:  
  - `icanhazdadjoke.com`  
  - `chucknorris.io`  
  - `wttr.in`

> 💡 This branch is meant for **development and experimentation**. Final results will be reflected in the `main` branch after merging.
